## Introduction
The early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project presents a binary classification model built from the ground up using Logistic Regression to predict whether a breast mass is malignant or benign. It leverages the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset and employs a comprehensive workflow including data preprocessing, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to build a robust and highly effective classifier.## Features  
- **Custom Logistic Regression:** The classification model is built from scratch, offering a transparent and in-depth understanding of the algorithm's mechanics.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify the feature space, reduce model complexity, and mitigate the risk of overfitting.
- **High-Performance Metrics:** Achieves an impressive F1-score of 98.11% and a Recall of nearly 100%, which is critical in a medical context to minimize false negatives.
